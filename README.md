Real-Time School Bus Tracking System
This project is a real-time school bus tracking system developed using Flutter, a framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

A new Flutter project.
# Overview
The real-time school bus tracking system aims to enhance child safety and parent convenience by providing real-time updates on the location of school buses. Parents and school administrators can track the buses' locations, receive notifications about delays or route changes, and communicate directly with drivers or school authorities through the mobile application.

# Features

Live Bus Tracking: View the real-time location of school buses on a map.
Route Information: Access details about bus routes, stops, and estimated arrival times.
Two-Way Communication: Communicate with bus drivers or school authorities through the app.
Safety Features: Panic buttons for emergency situations and speed monitoring to ensure child safety.
User Authentication: Secure login system for parents, drivers, and administrators.

# Technologies Used

Flutter: Front-end framework for building cross-platform applications.
Firebase: Backend services for user authentication, real-time database, and cloud messaging.
OpenStreetMap API: Integration for displaying maps and tracking bus locations.
Dart: Programming language used for Flutter development.
